GFMonline is a submod to use with GFM. Use both of them to play the game, this is not a standalone mod.
DODonline  and DODzomB are both submods to be used with Divergences of Darkness. The ZomB mod is the same as DoDOnline, but with zombies added with a decision you can press.

mapmod is the mapmod that is included with GFMonline, DoDOnline, and DoDZomB. This mod is used if you are using another mod that isn't mine. don't use it with any of the other mods I have as it is already included. 

The last 4 mods are cheat mods/mods that I have included for fun. Don't use it in a serious game.
